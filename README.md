# Mark-Haddawy-Clone
This is a clone of some of the look and functionality of [markhaddawy.com](https://www.markhaddawy.com). 

This is in my opinion, one of the best looking websites on the internet right now. Clean. To the point. I built this just for fun one afternoon with HTML and CSS. I used [Siema Carousel](https://github.com/pawelgrzybek/siema) as a lightweight image carousel.

### Note: This isn't mobile responsive, and I've disabled most of the links. If I continue to work on it, I'll update.
